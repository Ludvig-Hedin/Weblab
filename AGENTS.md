## Weblab Agents Guide

Actionable rules for repo agents—keep diffs minimal, safe, token‑efficient.

### ⚠️ Brand — Critical for All Agents

> **This product is Weblab** (domain: weblab.build, GitHub: github.com/Ludvig-Hedin/Weblab).
>
> - Single source of truth: `APP_NAME = 'Weblab'` exported from `packages/constants/src/editor.ts`. Always import it; never hardcode the brand name as a string literal in JSX or metadata.
> - Package scope is `@weblab/*`. DOM attributes are `data-weblab-*`. URL protocol is `weblab://`. Cache dir is `.weblab`.
> - The repo folder on disk is named `onlook/` for backward compatibility with shell history and tooling — it's a local path, not a user-facing identifier.
> - Allowed remaining "Onlook" references (do not strip):
>   - `LICENSE.md` — Apache-2.0 derivative-work attribution to On Off, Inc.
>   - `CODE_REVIEW_BACKLOG.md` — historical bug reports
>   - `DEPRECATED_PRELOAD_SCRIPT_SRCS` in `packages/constants/src/files.ts` — legacy CDN URLs the parser still recognizes and removes from old customer code
>   - Test fixtures with intentionally-deprecated inputs
> - Any other "Onlook" mention in code, docs, or UI is a bug — replace with `{APP_NAME}` (JSX) or `${APP_NAME}` (template literal).

### Purpose & Scope

- Audience: automated coding agents working within this repository.
- Goal: small, correct diffs aligned with the project’s architecture.
- Non-goals: editing generated artifacts, lockfiles, or `node_modules`.

### Agent Memory — Read First (Every Session)

Persistent, repo-scoped memory lives in `docs/agent-memory/`:

- **`user-preferences.md`** — read at the start of every session.
- `feature-log.md` — append on significant ships.
- `architecture-decisions.md` — append on architectural choices worth
  remembering.

See `docs/agent-memory/README.md` for the read/write protocol.

### Optional Context Pack

Before broad or cross-cutting work — and **always before planning a big
edit, refactor, or feature addition** — read the relevant files in
`docs/agent-context/`:

Read order for most tasks:

- `current-progress.md` — active worktree context and recent progress.
- `repo-map.md` — monorepo map and runtime flow.
- `development-setup.md` — commands, env, validation, and migrations.

Reference (read for the area you're touching):

- `packages-reference.md` — every package in `packages/*` (25 total).
- `trpc-routers-reference.md` — every tRPC router (21 total).
- `routes-reference.md` — every Next.js App Router route.

Deep dives:

- `editor-architecture.md` — canvas, iframe, MobX engine, sandbox.
- `ai-chat-architecture.md` — TipTap composer, mention/slash commands.
- `cms-architecture.md` — CMS workspace and bindings.
- `breakpoints-architecture.md` — responsive frame breakpoints.
- `data-api-architecture.md` — tRPC, Supabase, Drizzle, migrations, auth.
- `design-product-context.md` — brand, product, UI/design expectations.

### Repo Map

- Monorepo managed by Bun workspaces (see root `package.json`).
- App: `apps/web/client` (Next.js App Router + TailwindCSS).
- API routes: `apps/web/client/src/server/api/routers/*`, aggregated in
  `apps/web/client/src/server/api/root.ts`.
- Shared utilities: `packages/*` (e.g., `packages/utility`).

### Stack & Runtimes

- UI: Next.js App Router, TailwindCSS.
- API: tRPC + Zod (`apps/web/client/src/server/api/*`).
- Package manager: Bun only — use Bun for all installs and scripts; do not use
  npm, yarn, or pnpm.
- Deployment: `apps/web/client` is deployed on **Railway** (not Vercel). Do not
  check Vercel for deployment status or production logs.

### Agent Priorities

- Correctness first: minimal scope and targeted edits.
- Respect client/server boundaries in App Router.
- Prefer local patterns and existing abstractions; avoid one-off frameworks.
- Do not modify build outputs, generated files, or lockfiles.
- Use Bun for all scripts; do not introduce npm/yarn.
- Avoid running the local dev server in automation contexts.
- Respect type safety; avoid `any` unless necessary.

### Validation, Migrations, and Config Changes

- Never leave the app in a broken state with known errors. Before ending work,
  run the relevant validation for the files touched, such as typecheck, lint,
  tests, build checks, or targeted scripts.
- If a change requires database migrations, config updates, env changes, setup
  steps, or generated artifacts, either run the required local migration/config
  command yourself or clearly tell the project owner exactly what they must run
  manually.
- When migration or config commands cannot be run safely in the current
  environment, document the blocker, the exact command or file change still
  needed, and the expected impact if it is skipped.
- Do not mark a task complete until the app has been validated enough to confirm
  it is not left with avoidable runtime, build, type, lint, or config errors.

### Documentation Discipline

Documentation is part of "done" — not optional polish.

**Before a big edit / refactor / feature addition:**

1. Read `docs/agent-memory/user-preferences.md`.
2. Read `docs/agent-context/current-progress.md`.
3. Read the relevant `docs/agent-context/*.md` for the area you're touching.
4. Scan recent context if needed: `git log --oneline -30` and
   `docs/agent-memory/feature-log.md`.

**After a significant ship:**

1. Update affected `docs/agent-context/*.md` if architecture/contracts
   changed.
2. Append to `docs/agent-memory/feature-log.md` (qualifies = new feature, new
   router, new package, schema-shape change, significant refactor).
3. If a pattern is established or rejected, append to
   `docs/agent-memory/architecture-decisions.md`.
4. User-facing → add a changelog entry (and blog post if "very major").
5. Update `docs/agent-context/current-progress.md` if worktree state shifted.

**For new packages, routers, or top-level routes:** also update the matching
reference doc (`packages-reference.md`, `trpc-routers-reference.md`,
`routes-reference.md`).

### Changelog & Blog — Shipping Announcements

When you ship something user-facing, record it. Use your judgment on the tier:

| Tier | Threshold | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Major** | New user-facing feature, significant UI change, new page, important workflow or API change | Add a changelog entry |
| **Very major** | Full feature worth announcing publicly, major redesign, new integration, capability that changes how users work | Add a changelog entry **and** a blog post |

**Changelog entry** — `apps/web/client/src/lib/changelog-entries.ts`

Prepend a new object to `CHANGELOG_ENTRIES` (array is newest-first):

```ts
{
    slug: 'v1-6-short-slug',       // kebab-case, matches version prefix
    version: '1.6',                // bump the last entry's version by 0.1
    title: 'Feature Name',
    description: 'One or two sentences. What it does and why it matters.',
    date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',            // today's date
    tags: ['Tag1', 'Tag2'],        // 2–4 short labels
}
```

Include a UI image when the change has a visible UI: save a representative SVG
or screenshot to `apps/web/client/public/assets/changelog/` and note the path
in the description or as a comment.

**Blog post** (very major only) — `apps/web/client/content/blog/<slug>.mdx`

```mdx
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "One sentence summary shown in cards and OG."
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "Your Name"
authorImage: "https://github.com/<handle>.png"
category: "Product"        # Engineering | Product | Deep Dive
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
coverImage: "/assets/blog/<slug>.svg"
---
```

Save a cover image to `apps/web/client/public/assets/blog/`. Reuse an existing
SVG from that directory if creating a new image would be complex.

### Next.js App Router

- Default to Server Components. Add `use client` when using events,
  state/effects, browser APIs, or client-only libs.
- App structure: `apps/web/client/src/app/**` (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`,
  `route.ts`).
- Client providers live behind a client boundary (e.g.,
  `apps/web/client/src/trpc/react.tsx`).
- Example roots: `apps/web/client/src/app/layout.tsx` (RSC shell, providers
  wired, scripts gated by env).
- Components using `mobx-react-lite`'s `observer` must be client components
  (include `use client`).

### tRPC API

- Routers live in `apps/web/client/src/server/api/routers/**` and must be
  exported from `apps/web/client/src/server/api/root.ts`.
- Use `publicProcedure`/`protectedProcedure` from
  `apps/web/client/src/server/api/trpc.ts`; validate inputs with Zod.
- Serialization handled by SuperJSON; return plain objects/arrays.
- Client usage via `apps/web/client/src/trpc/react.tsx` (React Query + tRPC
  links).

### Auth & Supabase

- Server-side client: `apps/web/client/src/utils/supabase/server.ts` (uses Next
  headers/cookies). Use in server components, actions, and routes.
- Browser client: `apps/web/client/src/utils/supabase/client/index.ts` for
  client components.
- Never pass server-only clients into client code.

### Env & Config

- Define/validate env vars in `apps/web/client/src/env.ts` via
  `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`.
- Expose browser vars with `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` and declare in the `client` schema.
- Prefer `env` from `@/env`. In server-only helpers (e.g., base URL in
  `src/trpc/helpers.ts`), read `process.env` only for deployment vars like
  `VERCEL_URL`/`PORT`. Never use `process.env` in client code; in shared
  modules, guard with `typeof window === 'undefined'`.
- Import `./src/env` in `apps/web/client/next.config.ts` to enforce validation.

### Imports & Paths

- Use path aliases: `@/*` and `~/*` map to `apps/web/client/src/*` (see
  `apps/web/client/tsconfig.json`).
- Do not import server-only modules into client components. Limited exception:
  editor modules that already use `path`; reuse only there. Never import
  `process` in client code.
- Split code by environment if needed (server file vs client file).

### MobX + React Stores

- Create store instances with `useState(() => new Store())` for stability across
  renders.
- Keep active store in `useRef`; clean up async with
  `setTimeout(() => storeRef.current?.clear(), 0)` to avoid route-change races.
- Avoid `useMemo` for store instances; React may drop memoized values leading to
  data loss.
- Avoid putting the store instance in effect deps if it loops; split concerns
  (e.g., project vs branch).
- `observer` components are client-only. Place one client boundary at the
  feature entry; child observers need not include `use client` (e.g.,
  `apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/main.tsx`).
- Example store: `apps/web/client/src/components/store/editor/engine.ts:1` (uses
  `makeAutoObservable`).

### Design System — Source of Truth

The living design system lives at **`/design-system`** (source: `apps/web/client/src/app/design-system/page.tsx`).

- **Accessible on localhost** without auth. On any other host it requires a password set via `DESIGN_SYSTEM_PASSWORD` in `.env.local`.
- **What it covers:** every `@weblab/ui` component with all variants/states, the full color palette, typography scale, spacing scale, border-radius scale, shadows, and brand assets.
- **When you add or modify a component, token, or visual pattern** — update `page.tsx` to reflect it. New `@weblab/ui` component → add a demo section. Changed token name or value → update the corresponding swatch or control on that page.
- Live editing (color pickers, sliders) injects CSS variable overrides for preview only — permanent token changes go into `apps/web/client/src/app/globals.css` or the relevant CSS file.
- Use the design system page to verify visual consistency before shipping UI work. It is the single reference for "what the app looks like" across all components.

### Styling & UI

- TailwindCSS-first styling; global styles are already imported in
  `apps/web/client/src/app/layout.tsx`.
- Prefer existing UI components from `@weblab/ui` and local patterns.
- Preserve dark theme defaults via `ThemeProvider` usage in layout.

### Internationalization

- `next-intl` is configured; provider lives in
  `apps/web/client/src/app/layout.tsx`.
- Strings live in `apps/web/client/messages/*`. Add/modify keys there; avoid
  hardcoded user-facing text.
- Keep keys stable; prefer additions over breaking renames.

### Common Pitfalls

- Missing `use client` where needed (events/browser APIs) causes unbound events;
  a single boundary at the feature root is sufficient.
- New tRPC routers not exported in `src/server/api/root.ts` (endpoints
  unreachable).
- Env vars not typed/exposed in `src/env.ts` cause runtime/edge failures. Prefer
  `env`; avoid new `process.env` reads in client code.
- Importing server-only code into client components (bundling/runtime errors).
  Note: `path` is already used in specific client code-editor modules; avoid
  expanding Node API usage beyond those areas.
- Bypassing i18n by hardcoding strings instead of using message files/hooks.
- Avoid `useMemo` to create MobX stores (risk of lost references); avoid
  synchronous cleanup on route change (race conditions).

### Context Discipline (for Agents)

- Search narrowly with ripgrep; open only files you need.
- Read small sections; avoid `node_modules`, `.next`, large assets.
- Propose minimal diffs aligned with existing conventions; avoid wide refactors.

### Notes

- Unit tests can be run with `bun test`
- Run type checking with `bun run typecheck`
- Apply database updates to local dev with `bun run db:push`
- Refrain from running the dev server
- DO NOT run `db:gen`. This is reserved for the maintainer.
- DO NOT use any type unless necessary

/**
 * Captures before/after content of files the agent edits, computed at finalize
 * (read after) against a `before` side gathered one of two ways.
 *
 * Claude drives this from a `PreToolUse` hook: `recordBefore` snapshots each
 * file just before the write. More robust than parsing assistant tool-use
 * blocks, since it sees the real filesystem state regardless of how the model
 * phrased the edit.
 *
 * Codex has no pre-tool hook — the first we hear of a write is a `file_change`
 * item reporting one that already happened. There `prime` seeds the files that
 * were already dirty when the turn began, and `recordAfterTheFact` reconstructs
 * everything else from the file's HEAD blob. See the two methods for why that
 * covers every case.

 * Line endings, flattened for comparison and diffing only.
 *
 * On Windows `core.autocrlf=true` is the Git-for-Windows default, so the
 * working tree is CRLF while every agent's edit tool writes LF. Comparing a
 * file's pre-edit CRLF form against its post-edit LF form makes every line
 * differ by its terminator, so a one-line edit renders as a whole-file rewrite
 * with garbage `+N −M` counts and review comments that anchor to the wrong
 * lines.
 *
 * Only the comparison and the patch are normalized. `FileDiff.before`/`after`
 * keep the bytes actually on disk, because `restoreFiles` writes `before` back
 * verbatim and undo has to round-trip exactly. That holds on the git-baseline
 * path too, but only because `fileAtHead` reads through `cat-file --filters`
 * rather than `show`: the stored blob is LF whatever the working tree is, and
 * writing that back over a CRLF file rewrote every line ending in it.
 *
 * The leading BOM goes the same way and for the same reason. Visual Studio and
 * several Windows editors write one; agent edit tools generally do not preserve
 * it, and `readFileSync(…, "utf8")` hands it back as a real `﻿` character
 * rather than stripping it — so dropping it would otherwise show up as the
 * first line having changed when its text is identical.
 *
 * One consequence worth knowing: an edit that changes *nothing but* line
 * endings or the BOM now reads as no change at all, so it is neither shown nor
 * committed. That is the intended trade — it is noise, not an edit.

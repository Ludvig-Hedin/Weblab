 * teardown leaks into the reducer's module graph — which is what lets the
 * reducer tests run without ever loading the SDK's `child_process` path.
 *
 * The server is a lazily-created singleton. Airship's interaction model is
 * "point at an element, type a sentence, watch it happen", and a cold
 * `opencode serve` handshake on the front of every edit is the wrong tax to
 * pay when one process can serve them all. Nothing is lost by sharing it: the
 * knobs that genuinely vary per turn — model, agent, permissions — are all
 * settable per *session*, not per server.
 *
 * The cost of sharing is that the event stream carries every session on the
 * server, which is why `sessionIdOf` filtering in the reducer is not optional.

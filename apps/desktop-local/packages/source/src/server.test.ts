/**
 * Turning what the browser reports into a path on disk.
 *
 * The input is a dev-server URL path, not a filesystem path, and the two look
 * alike enough to be confused: `/src/App.tsx` is rooted as far as `resolve` is
 * concerned. Getting it wrong is quiet — the agent is handed context from the
 * wrong file, or none at all — so the cases are pinned here.

/**
 * Frames — the canvas's unit of content, in the design-tool sense of the word: a named,
 * explicitly-sized container that clips what is inside it.
 *
 * Ours holds a live copy of the user's app in a same-origin iframe. That choice
 * is the whole feature. Scaling the app with a CSS transform would have been far
 * less machinery, but a transform does not change what the app *believes* about
 * its viewport: `innerWidth` would stay the browser's, and every media query
 * would answer for the window rather than the device. An iframe at 375px is a
 * real 375px viewport, so `@media (max-width: 560px)` fires inside it and keeps
 * firing at 10% zoom, which is what makes two breakpoints visible side by side.
 *
 * The costs are honest and worth naming: each frame is a full app instance with
 * its own HMR socket and its own JS realm (see `../realm.ts`), and there is no
 * way to change a frame's user-agent or `devicePixelRatio` — so these are true
 * viewports, not device emulation.

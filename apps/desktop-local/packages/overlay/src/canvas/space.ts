/**
 * The canvas coordinate system — and the only place in the overlay allowed to do
 * coordinate math.
 *
 * There are three spaces:
 *
 * - **frame** — inside a frame's own viewport. This is what
 *   `getBoundingClientRect()` returns when called on a node *within* a frame,
 *   and it is the space every CSS value the inspector reads or writes lives in.
 *   A 200px-wide box is 200 here at every zoom level.
 * - **world** — the infinite canvas. A frame occupies `(x, y, width, height)`.
 *   One world unit is one frame pixel, so frame-space `(0,0)` for a frame is
 *   world `(frame.x, frame.y)`.
 * - **screen** — the shell's viewport, what `getBoundingClientRect()` returns in
 *   the shell document. Chrome (outlines, handles, drop lines) is positioned
 *   here, at 1× and untransformed, so a 1px border stays 1px at 10% zoom the way
 *   it does in a design tool.
 *
 * The world→screen transform is `translate(x, y) scale(scale)` with
 * `transform-origin: 0 0` and never a rotation, which is what keeps every
 * conversion an axis-independent multiply-add and lets an axis-aligned rect stay
 * an axis-aligned rect.
 *
 * Frame→screen deliberately does *not* recompose that transform by hand. The
 * shell asks the browser for `iframe.getBoundingClientRect()`, which already has
 * the world transform composited into it, so the conversion picks up the
 * viewport's position and any future ancestor transform for free — and cannot
 * drift out of sync with the CSS the way a re-derived matrix would.

/**
 * A small map of the whole canvas, and a way to move around it.
 *
 * The canvas is infinite and until now nothing on screen said where on it you
 * were. Pan away from your frames and there was no affordance pointing back —
 * only ⇧1, which answers the question by throwing away the zoom level you were
 * working at. This is the cheap continuous answer: everything you have, at a
 * glance, with a box showing the part you are looking at, draggable.
 *
 * **Rectangles, not thumbnails.** Every frame is a live same-origin `iframe`
 * running a full instance of the user's app. There is no paint capture anywhere
 * in the overlay and no way to add one cheaply — `FrameAgent` exposes DOM, not
 * pixels — an `iframe` cannot be duplicated, and cloning one would boot a ninth
 * app against a cap of eight. So a frame is drawn the way `ChromeLayer` draws
 * everything else: a positioned `div` with the numbers written into it.
 *
 * **The bounds include where you are looking**, not just where the frames are,
 * and that is the difference between a map and a decoration. Projecting the
 * frames alone means the indicator slides off the card the moment you pan past
 * them — exactly when a map is the only thing that could help. The cost is that
 * the projection rescales while you are outside your content; inside it, which
 * is the common case, the frames' union dominates and the map holds still.
 *
 * **The card cannot be dismissed.** It used to carry a close button, with the
 * only way back a checkbox under the zoom readout — no shortcut, no palette,
 * and a README that documented the hiding and not the restoring. A control
 * whose off state is discoverable and whose on state is not is a trap, and the
 * map is small enough that nothing was bought by allowing it. It is furniture
 * now: always on the canvas stage, still stood down under 900px where it would
 * collide with the bar, and still skipped in edit mode by its host.
 *
 * **Accessibility.** The projection is `aria-hidden` and nothing in it takes
 * focus. It is a pointer-only enhancement, and everything it does is reachable
 * without it: ⇧1 fits, ⇧2 zooms to the selection, and the frame list beside it
 * is a real keyboard-navigable list of the same frames. A draggable
 * `role="application"` region here would be a worse answer pretending to be a
 * better one.

 * scale, which changes how far the next pointer move travels — a stationary
 * pointer on a rescaling map is the rubber-banding this fixes. Frozen for the
 * length of the gesture, one pixel of pointer means the same distance from
 * press to release.
 *
 * `grab` is where inside the indicator you took hold of it, in card pixels.
 * Without it every move re-centres the box on the cursor, so grabbing an edge
 * snaps the view by half a box before you have moved at all. Holding the offset
 * is what makes the indicator track the pointer instead of jumping to it — the
 * behaviour Photoshop's Navigator has always had, and the one VS Code's minimap
 * grew in microsoft/vscode#64459. A press *outside* the indicator has no offset

/*
 * Do the specimens reach the branches they claim to?
 *
 * `SpecimenSpec.covers` is prose, and prose does not fail. This is what makes it
 * answerable — and it exists because the two bugs it would have caught were both
 * live for a long time and both invisible from the outside:
 *
 *  - the gradient specimen resolved `.tiles`, the grid *container*, which paints
 *    nothing. `Inspector/Sections/Fill · Gradient` rendered an empty section, and
 *    an empty Fill section is a legitimate state for an element with no fill —
 *    so the panel was correctly reporting the wrong element.
 *  - the SVG-child specimen resolved the `<svg>` root, where `isSvgChild` is
 *    false by definition. Two stories claimed to demonstrate the most
 *    aggressively gated path in `renderSections`, and that path had no coverage
 *    anywhere in the catalogue.
 *
 * Only the *structural* predicates are asserted here. `hasFill`, `hasStroke` and
 * `hasBounds` read computed style, and happy-dom does not apply the specimen
 * stylesheet — those are the browser tier's job, which is the same division of
 * labour `test-support.ts` already documents.

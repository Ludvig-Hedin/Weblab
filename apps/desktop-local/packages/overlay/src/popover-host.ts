/*
 * The layer every anchored popover — and the tooltip — is drawn on.
 *
 * **Why a host at all.** A popover rendered next to its trigger is clipped
 * twice over: `.__airship-insp-body` is `overflow-y: auto` (and per spec
 * `overflow-x: visible` computes to `auto` when the other axis is not visible,
 * so it clips on *both*), and `.__airship-dock` is `overflow: hidden`. A
 * `position: absolute` menu inside the design panel is cut off at the section
 * edge and scrolls away with the content. It has to be parented somewhere that
 * is not inside either box.
 *
 * **Why inside `#__airship-root` rather than a sibling layer.** The obvious
 * choice — `ChromeLayer`, where the selection outlines live — is wrong, and
 * subtly so: it and the root carry the *same* `z-index`, and the root is
 * appended second, so the docks paint over it (see `chrome-layer.ts`, which
 * chose that on purpose so an outline runs under a panel rather than being
 * clipped at its edge). A menu mounted there renders behind an opaque dock.
 * Hosting inside the root instead — as its last child — puts the popover above
 * every dock *and* inherits three things a third body-level layer would have to
 * re-earn: the `--ap-*` token vars (scoped to the root), the
 * `${ROOT} button:hover .ic` icon-state rules, and membership of
 * `edit-guard.ts`'s `CHROME` list, without which every click inside a colour
 * picker would fall through and re-select the element underneath it.
 *
 * That last point is also why the tooltip moves here: mounted on the chrome
 * layer it was painted *behind* the panels, so every tooltip in the design
 * inspector was invisible.
 *
 * **One at a time.** A select and a colour picker are never usefully open
 * together, and a singleton makes outside-press, Escape and "the panel just
 * rebuilt" one code path each instead of a registry to keep in step.

 *    token. Direct evidence, and the normal case in a real design system: the
 *    `var()` is in the stylesheet, not on the element. Without this pass such a
 *    value was reported as a coincidence, so its badge read "Matches" rather
 *    than "Using" and offered no way to detach.
 * 4. **By inline `var()`** — written into the element's own style attribute,
 *    which is what the panel does when a token is applied. Strongest, because
 *    nothing else can have put it there.
 *
 * Call it **once per render with every property at a time**, not once per

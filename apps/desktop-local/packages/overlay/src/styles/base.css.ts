   busy. The --ap-icon-* ramp exists for exactly this and was previously unused,
   so every glyph inherited --ap-text-primary (#FFF).

   The tone comes through a custom property rather than being set flat, because
   this selector is \`#id .class\` and it matches the glyph's own span. A rule
   that matches an element beats any \`color\` that element would have inherited,
   whatever the parent's specificity — so a button could not tint its own glyph.
   Send was the visible casualty: \`.action.primary\` sets white, and the caret
   painted #BEBEBE on the blue anyway, which is most of why it read as badly
   set rather than merely small. A custom property inherits, so any ancestor can
   set --ic-tone and the var() picks it up here with no specificity contest. */

/* Scrollbars. One definition, applied by class, for every scroll container the
   overlay owns.

   These were \`scrollbar-width: none\` plus \`::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none }\`
   — a deliberate-looking choice that quietly broke the mouse. A trackpad can
   swipe a horizontal rail sideways and a hidden scrollbar costs it nothing; a
   mouse wheel produces vertical delta only, so with no scrollbar, no wheel
   handler and no visible edge, the chips past the fold were simply unreachable.
   The people who built it were on trackpads, which is exactly why it survived.

   Transparent at rest so the chrome stays quiet, tinted once the surface is
   under the pointer or holds focus. \`scrollbar-width: thin\` reserves its gutter
   whether or not the thumb is painted, so revealing it shifts nothing — and the
   rails are \`:empty { display: none }\`, so the ~6px is only spent when there is
   something to scroll, which is when you want the affordance anyway.

   Both syntaxes: \`scrollbar-color\` is the standard one (Firefox, Chrome 121+),
   \`::-webkit-scrollbar\` covers Safari and older WebKit. An engine that honours
   the first ignores the second, so they do not fight.

   The \`--ap-scrollbar-*\` ramp has been shipping from @airship/editor-tokens

   cross-axis value at all — the panels it dresses hold rows that are
   occasionally wider than the dock, and \`overflow-x: hidden\` would clip them

/* Edit mode: the page is a canvas, not an app. Element-level cursors (a link's
   pointer, an input's text caret) beat \`document.body.style.cursor\`, so the
   arrow has to be forced from here — and text selection has to be off, or
   dragging across the page selects paragraphs instead of moving elements.

   The cursor is a plain arrow and not a crosshair, which is what this was for a
   long time. A crosshair is what a design tool shows when you are about to *draw*
   something — it means "click and drag defines a new rect". Edit mode does the
   opposite: it points at things that already exist. Forcing a crosshair over
   every element in the page turned a direct-manipulation surface into something
   that read like a screenshot tool, and it fought the resize and grab cursors
   the chrome sets deliberately.
   The \`:not([data-…-drag])\` guard hands the cursor over to the drag rule below
   for the duration of a gesture, which would otherwise lose on specificity. The
   \`:not([data-…-text-edit])\` guard on the descendant does the same job for the
   node being edited in place: this selector carries two ID-weight \`:not()\`
   arguments and declares \`!important\`, so the rules in \`portable.css.ts\` cannot
   beat it on merit, and without the exemption you get a crosshair and
   \`user-select: none\` sitting on top of the text you are typing into. Inline
   only — which is exactly why it is the sort of thing that gets found late.

   Scoped to \`:not([data-…-shell])\` because it only applies to the inline
   overlay. On the canvas this document contains no app to make inert — the
   frames handle that with \`pointer-events: none\` — and blanket-crosshairing
   the shell would put a crosshair on the chat composer. */

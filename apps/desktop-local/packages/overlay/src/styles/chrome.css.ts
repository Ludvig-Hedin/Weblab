/* Hover + selection boxes.

   Everything on the canvas is drawn at exactly 1px with no radius, and that is
   the single biggest thing separating chrome that reads as an editor from chrome
   that reads as a debug tool. Two reasons it has to be this way:

   A rounded outline is a claim about the element. The box is measured from
   \`getBoundingClientRect()\` and traces the border box exactly; putting a 4px
   radius on it draws corners the element does not have, and on a square element
   — most elements — the mismatch is visible at 100% zoom. A design tool's selection is
   square whatever the object's own corner radius is, for the same reason.

   And there is no transition here on purpose. The hover box is re-\`place()\`d on
   every \`mousemove\`, so a transition on \`all\` interpolates left/top/width/height
   between two elements and the outline visibly trails the cursor. It read as lag
   in the overlay rather than as easing.

   Hover carries no fill either. What distinguishes hover from selection is the
   handles, which is the distinction a design tool draws; a tinted fill on top of that
   just puts a wash over the thing you are trying to look at. */

   frame, and a clip applies to descendants — so a badge hanging above a box near
   the top of a frame was being sliced in half by its own outline. As a sibling
   it is positioned independently and clips on its own terms, which for a badge
   is "not at all": it is an annotation *about* the frame's contents, like the
   frame's own title, not something drawn inside them.

   Anchored to the top-left of the box by default, with the corner nearest the

/* Resize grips: four visible corner squares, and four *invisible*
   strips along the edges between them.

   A design tool does not draw a square at the midpoint of an edge — it makes the whole
   edge grabbable — and eight white squares crowding a small element was most of
   what made the selection read as heavy. All eight are still registered as
   dnd-kit draggables in \`picker.ts\`; only paint and geometry are decided here.

   The strips span corner to corner rather than sitting at a midpoint, so the
   entire edge is a target. They are inset by half a corner handle at each end so
   the two never fight over the same pixel, and centred on the border so their
   6px of slop falls evenly inside and outside it. Expressing the span as
   \`left: 4px; right: 4px\` rather than a computed width is what makes this free:
   the handles are children of a box that is already sized to the element, so the
   browser derives \`width − 8\` and clamps at zero on its own. There is no

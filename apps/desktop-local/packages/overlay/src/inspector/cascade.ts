 *   `.btn`, and only they know which.
 * - **State** — what does this element look like on `:hover`, and how do we let
 *   someone edit that?
 *
 * They share a scan because they are the same question wearing two hats: *which
 * rule does this declaration belong in*. Building them on `matchedRules` rather
 * than a second stylesheet walker also means they inherit its realm-awareness
 * for free — a `@media` query in a 393px frame is evaluated against that frame.

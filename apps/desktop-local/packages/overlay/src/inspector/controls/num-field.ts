/*
 * The panel's one numeric field.
 *
 * There used to be five: `number-scrub`, `glyphField` in panel.ts, and a local
 * `field()` inside each of `padding.ts`, `quad-field.ts` and `paint.ts`, plus
 * the colour row's alpha input. They rendered the same markup and disagreed
 * about everything else — which of them clamped, which appended a unit, which
 * accepted `auto`, which could be dragged. Four of the five accepted the string
 * "banana" and silently reverted on blur, and none of the five noticed a paste.
 *
 * This is a *primitive*, not a `ControlHandle`: it knows nothing about CSS
 * properties, the change set or the selection. That is deliberate, and it is
 * what lets call sites with very different commit shapes — one property, four
 * longhands, an entry in a serialised shadow list, one channel of a colour —
 * all share one field.
 *
 * Two behaviours are worth naming because they are the reason it exists:
 *
 * **Nothing illegal can be typed.** The filter runs on `beforeinput`, so it
 * sees pastes, drops and IME composition, not just keystrokes — and it works on
 * the *prospective* value, so it rejects before the character lands rather than
 * repairing afterwards. What counts as legal is per-field: `auto` is a real
 * width and nonsense in an opacity, `%` is a real inset and nonsense in a
 * z-index. Each field declares what it takes.
 *
 * **Every field drags.** `glyphField` used to argue that fields without a
 * `Descriptor` "have no min/max/step to read, and a scrub without clamping is
 * worse than no scrub". That was true, and it was an argument about where the
 * three numbers come from — not about whether they can exist. They come from
 * `NumSpec` instead, and Position, Size, blur radii and the rest now scrub like
 * everything else.

/**
 * The 3×3 auto-layout alignment pad.
 *
 * One click writes **both** `justify-content` and `align-items` — that is the
 * whole point of the control, and it is why this is not two segmented groups.
 * They land as two separate `onChange` calls, so the change set records two
 * deltas and the agent sees exactly the two properties a developer would write.
 *
 * Which axis a click means flips with the flex direction, so the pad reads its
 * direction live rather than being rebuilt: in a row, the column index is the
 * main axis (`justify-content`) and the row index is the cross axis; in a
 * column they swap.
 *
 * The preview "ink" in each cell is drawn with CSS pseudo-elements rather than
 * nine more SVGs — nine icons would cost ~8 KB to say something three
 * positioned bars say better.

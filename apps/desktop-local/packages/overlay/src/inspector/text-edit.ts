/*
 * In-place text editing.
 *
 * Double-click a node whose content is a single text node and type, with the
 * caret where you clicked. `Enter` and `T` do the same to the selection but
 * select the whole string instead, which is what you want when the gesture was
 * a keystroke and there was no click to take a point from.
 *
 * **Escape commits.** It does not revert — `⌘Z` does, through the ordinary
 * history stack (`history.push({kind:"text"})` → `history-ops.applyText`). That
 * is the design-tool ladder: Escape leaves the edit with the layer still selected, and a
 * second Escape falls through to the picker's binding and deselects. There is
 * deliberately no `cancel()`: it had exactly one trigger, Escape, and a state
 * machine with no user-facing entry is dead weight. The one job it did
 * implicitly — never shipping an edit for a node that has gone away — is done
 * properly by the `isConnected` check in `commit`.
 *
 * **Scoped to leaf text nodes on purpose.** No rich text, no partial-range
 * formatting, no editing a node that also has element children. That covers the
 * overwhelming majority of real edits — a heading, a label, a button — and
 * avoids the entire `Selection`/`Range` swamp, where the next question is always
 * "what happens when you bold half a word that lives in a `<span>` a component
 * generated". `textTargetIn` is the one concession: it walks *down* to the sole
 * text-bearing descendant, so double-clicking a button's padding edits the label
 * inside it.
 *
 * One hook, `setTextOwner`, carries the whole of the editor's arrangement with
 * the rest of the overlay, because all of it has to move together and every
 * previous split left a piece behind. Downstream it becomes:
 *
 * 1. `EditGuard.allowTextOn` — presses on the node keep their *default* (the
 *    caret, drag-select, double-click-word) while still being stopped from
 *    reaching the app. The opposite arrangement from the dnd-kit hatch.
 * 2. `SelectionController.setTextOwner` — the picker stays live and declines
 *    exactly the clicks that land inside the text, so a click anywhere else can
 *    commit and move on.
 * 3. `DesignPanel`'s context snapshot — which element the commit is recorded
 *    against, taken now rather than at commit time.
 * 4. On the canvas, `FrameManager.setTextFrame` — the owning frame goes live for
 *    the duration, because a caret cannot be synthesised from the shell.
 *
 * React will clobber `textContent` on its next render, so an edit has to be
 * shipped or reverted before an HMR round-trip — the same constraint the inline
 * style previews already live under.

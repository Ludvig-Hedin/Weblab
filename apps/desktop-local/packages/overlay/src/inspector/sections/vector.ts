/**
 * Vector — the paint and stroke properties of an SVG shape.
 *
 * Written as CSS properties rather than SVG presentation attributes. Both work
 * and the attribute is what most SVG files carry, but a CSS declaration is what
 * the rest of this inspector produces, what the preview stylesheet can apply,
 * and what wins over an attribute in the cascade — so an edit here is visible
 * immediately even on a shape whose markup sets `fill="red"`.
 *
 * That cascade argument holds on the shape itself and fails one level up: on
 * an `<svg>` *root*, a declaration only reaches the shapes by inheritance,
 * which any presentation attribute on a child beats. Every hand-built row
 * here therefore reads and writes through `svg-paint.ts`'s plan — self, the
 * root's `color` for a `currentColor` icon, or a fan across the declaring
 * shapes.
 *
 * Known deferral: the four enum cells at the bottom (`stroke-linecap`,
 * `stroke-linejoin`, `fill-rule`, `vector-effect`) still go through
 * `ctx.fieldCell`, whose write is bound to the selection — so on a root they
 * remain shadowed by a child's `stroke-linecap="round"`. Routing them through
 * the plan means teaching `fieldCell` to take a write target, a much larger
 * change for four rarely-touched properties.

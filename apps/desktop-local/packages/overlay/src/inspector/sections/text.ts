 * The axes a variable font is chosen *for*, in a movable popover.
 *
 * The section had a weight select and nothing else — no width, no optical sizing, no
 * numeral variants, and no way to reach a font's own axes at all except by typing into
 * the CSS pane.
 *
 * It arrived as a collapsed sub-section, which was the wrong shape twice over. A
 * nested `.sect` paid the body inset a second time, so its heading sat 48px in
 * while the rows it headed sat at 24 — and the 48px it cost every row was
 * exactly what pushed them past their wrap threshold, so each label broke onto
 * its own line and each control went full-bleed under it. That much is now
 * fixed in the stylesheet. What is not fixable there is the rest of it: six
 * rows nobody needs most of the time, in the middle of the section, pushing
 * everything below them down whenever they were open.
 *
 * A popover answers both. It is out of the section's everyday height, and being
 * movable it can sit beside the text it is tuning rather than on top of it —
 * which is the whole point of a variable-axis control you are watching the page
 * respond to. Same `.pop-form` shape as the stroke settings.
 *
 * The two `*-settings` properties stay free text: their grammar is `"wght" 450, "opsz" 32`,
 * the axis tags are per-font, and a closed control would have to either guess a font's axes
 * or refuse the ones it does not know.

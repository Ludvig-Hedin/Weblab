/**
 * The CSS pane — the inspector's "why does it look like this" view.
 *
 * Four blocks, in the order the question is usually asked:
 *
 *  1. the box model, because most layout questions are about a gap;
 *  2. `element.style { … }`, the session's own overrides, editable;
 *  3. the stylesheet rules that match, strongest first, with the losers struck
 *     through — the provenance the computed list can never give;
 *  4. every computed property, grouped and filterable.
 *
 * (3) is the expensive one and is collapsed on first open, scanning only when
 * expanded: an unpurged Tailwind build can carry six figures of rules, and
 * nobody should pay for that to look at a padding.

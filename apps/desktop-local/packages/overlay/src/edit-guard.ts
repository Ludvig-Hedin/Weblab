 *
 * `cls("layer")` is a *marker class* stamped on those individual nodes — see
 * `picker.ts`, `inspector/reorder.ts`, `inspector/panel.ts` — not the
 * `.chrome-layer` container they sit in. The distinction matters: the container
 * is deliberately absent, and so is the per-frame furniture `frame-chrome.ts`
 * puts on it (the title, the size badge, the eight grips). Those are the only
 * chrome that floats over a *frame* rather than over the app, and a wheel or a
 * space-drag there belongs to the canvas or to the frame beneath — which is what
 * `CanvasViewport.onWheel` goes on to work out. Adding the container here would
 * make that whole band dead to the wheel, and would quietly change the picker,
 * space-drag and `EditGuard.onPress` too, since all four share this predicate.
 *
 * The canvas viewport is deliberately *not* here, and is deliberately not a
 * child of the root either. It is not chrome floating over the app — it is the
 * substrate the app sits in, and a pointer over it is a pointer over the user's
 * content, which is exactly what the picker needs to be told.

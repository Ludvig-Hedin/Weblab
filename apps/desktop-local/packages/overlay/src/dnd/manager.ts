 * Feedback plugin — which returns before that line for `feedback: "none"`. So
 * the sensor still *starts* a drag on Space and still ends one on Space, Enter
 * or Tab, but every arrow key in between does nothing at all.
 *
 * What the user gets is worse than "nothing happens": the row latches into its
 * dragging state, the Accessibility plugin has already announced the handle as
 * `aria-roledescription="draggable"`, and the sensor's document-capture listener
 * calls `preventDefault` on Tab — so the one key that should let you leave ends
 * the phantom drag *and* eats the focus move. Unregistering the sensor for these
 * draggables is what stops a promise being made that nothing can keep; the
 * keyboard route is then a real one, next to the drag rather than pretending to
 * be it (see `FramesPanel.moveBy`, and `num-field.ts`'s `stepBy` beside its
 * scrub).
 *
 * The pointer constraint has to be restated because a per-draggable `sensors`
 * array *replaces* the manager's list rather than extending it — omitted, every
 * press on a handle would begin a drag with no threshold at all.

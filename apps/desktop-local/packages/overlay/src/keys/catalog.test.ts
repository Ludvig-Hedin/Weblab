/*
 * The contract the catalog has to keep.
 *
 * Four properties, and the reason each is a test rather than a convention:
 *
 * - **Unique ids and titles.** An id is what code refers to and a duplicate
 *   would silently shadow; a duplicate title makes the palette unreadable, and
 *   the palette is a list of titles.
 * - **No ambiguous chord.** Several pairs share one on purpose and are told
 *   apart by mutually exclusive guards — ⌫ is Delete element in edit mode and
 *   Delete frame in view mode. `canvas/frame-chrome.ts` argues that pairing in
 *   thirty lines of prose and says outright that registration order "is *not*
 *   the guarantee and must not become one". This is where that stops being
 *   prose.
 * - **Every declared command is bound.** The compiler catches an id that does
 *   not exist; nothing catches a command that exists and is bound nowhere,
 *   which is a row in the palette that cannot be run and a line in CONTROLS.md
 *   that is a lie.
 * - **No value imports.** `scripts/gen-controls.mjs` loads `catalog.ts` under
 *   plain Node, where an extensionless value import does not resolve. Type
 *   imports are erased before resolution and are free.

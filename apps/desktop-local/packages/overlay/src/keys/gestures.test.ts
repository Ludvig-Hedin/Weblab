/*
 * Keeping the gesture table honest, in both directions.
 *
 * Gestures cannot be `run()` callbacks — space-to-pan is a state between a
 * keydown and a keyup, a wheel is a stream — so unlike a command, nothing about
 * a gesture is checked by the compiler. The table is prose, and prose about
 * code rots.
 *
 * So it is checked by scanning, the way `tooltip.copy.test.ts` checks tooltip
 * copy and `scripts/check-css.mjs` checks the no-transition rule:
 *
 * - **Forward.** Every `impl` resolves — the file exists and the symbol is in
 *   it. A renamed handler fails here rather than leaving a row that describes
 *   nothing.
 * - **Backward.** Every file that registers a pointer or wheel listener is
 *   named by some row. This is the half that matters in a year: it catches the
 *   right-drag somebody adds and never documents, which is precisely how the
 *   input surface got into the state this table was written to fix.

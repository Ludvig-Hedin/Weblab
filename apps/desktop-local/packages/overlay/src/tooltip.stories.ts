/*
 * The overlay's tooltips.
 *
 * Native `title` was doing this job and cannot: it opens after about a second,
 * cannot be styled, and — the reason this module exists — cannot show a keyboard
 * shortcut. A design tool's tooltips carry their own shortcut, and that is a
 * real part of why an app feels like someone cared rather than like a prototype.
 *
 * One delegated listener and one shared node, not a tooltip per control. Every
 * icon button in the editor would otherwise be an extra DOM node and an extra
 * pair of listeners for something shown a few hundred milliseconds at a time.
 *
 * Two placement rules make up most of the design, and both are about the
 * inspector specifically:
 *
 * **Above inside the panel body, below everywhere else.** The panel is the one
 * place in the editor where full-width controls stack six pixels apart, so a tip
 * placed below a row lands squarely on the next one — the control you are on
 * your way to. The rows above it are values you have already read.
 *
 * **Clamped to the dock before the viewport.** A tip on a caret at the right
 * edge of a 360px panel is inside the window and still outside the panel,
 * hanging past a rounded border with nothing under it. That reads as a bug
 * rather than as that control's label.
 *
 * Hovering is driven by dispatching a real `pointerover`, which is what the
 * delegated listener is bound to. No new test dependency — the same raw-event
 * idiom `select.stories.ts` already uses for its `.click()`.

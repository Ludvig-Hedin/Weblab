/*
 * Guard the CSS template literals in `src/styles/*.css.ts`.
 *
 * Those files are one big backtick string each, so an unescaped backtick inside
 * a CSS comment — the natural way to write `position: relative` in prose —
 * silently terminates the literal and turns the rest of the stylesheet into
 * TypeScript. `tsc` does catch it, but it reports a parse error thirty rules
 * downstream of the cause and reads as a compiler bug. This names it.
 *
 * The scan starts at `export const css = \`` and walks the literal properly,
 * stepping over `${ ... }` interpolations (which may themselves contain nested
 * template literals) so only backticks in *CSS* text are reported.
 *
 * It also enforces one design rule that cannot be expressed in the type system:
 * canvas chrome does not animate. See `NO_TRANSITION`.

 * Stylesheets that may not declare a `transition`, and why.
 *
 * The hover and selection outlines are re-positioned on every pointer move, by
 * writing a measured rect straight into `left`/`top`/`width`/`height`. A
 * transition on those properties interpolates between one element's box and the
 * next, so the outline visibly trails the cursor and lags behind whatever it is
 * supposed to be tracking. It does not read as easing; it reads as the overlay
 * being slow.
 *
 * This is not obvious from the rule that causes it — the offending declaration
 * was a plausible-looking `transition: all .05s ease` that survived a long time
 * — and it is exactly the sort of thing a well-meaning motion pass would put
 * back. Hence a build check rather than a comment.
 *
 * Chrome that is *shown and hidden* rather than moved may still fade; list it in
 * `allow` with the reason, and keep that list short.

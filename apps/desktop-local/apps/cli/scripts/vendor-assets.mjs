// Copies the runtime assets the server serves but cannot import into the CLI's
// own dist/, so the published tarball is self-contained.
//
// Why this exists: packages/server/src/proxy.ts serves three things it resolves
// at runtime rather than importing — the overlay IIFE, the bippy hook IIFE, and
// the editor's woff2 fonts. They are assets, so no bundler can inline them.
//
// In this monorepo they resolve fine through node_modules. In a published
// install they do not exist at all: tsup inlines @airship/server into the CLI
// bundle, so proxy.ts's import.meta.url ends up pointing at the installed CLI's
// dist/, where no @airship/* package is on disk. dist/vendor/ is the copy that
// makes that case work. See the fallback in proxy.ts.
//
// Sources are resolved through the packages' own export maps rather than
// hardcoded ../../packages/… paths, so a layout change there fails loudly here
// instead of silently shipping a stale asset.

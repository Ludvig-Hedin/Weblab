# F-475 — Tab-complete metering is fire-and-forget AFTER generation

- **Discovered:** 2026-05-28 (validate-feature F-470..F-479 run)
- **Where:** [apps/web/client/src/app/api/ai/tab-complete/route.ts:177](apps/web/client/src/app/api/ai/tab-complete/route.ts#L177)
- **Symptom:** Increment is `void` and runs after `generateTabCompletion` resolves. A fast keystroke spammer never sees the limit because dozens of in-flight requests resolve before any increment lands.
- **Next step:** either gate up-front (precheck + atomic increment), or add a per-user in-flight cap so concurrent completions can't exceed a small constant N.
- **Risk if ignored:** cheap concurrent abuse with no daily-cap pressure.
- **Tags:** `#bug` `#billing` `#concurrency`

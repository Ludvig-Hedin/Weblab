# Node 22 stream compat noise in Convex client logs

- **Discovered:** 2026-05-26 (validate-feature F-120..F-135 run)
- **Where:** server logs during any failed `fetchQuery` call from the editor route.
- **Symptom:** `TypeError: controller[kState].transformAlgorithm is not a
  function` appears in stderr next to legitimate request errors. Originates
  inside the Convex client's `Response` body handling on Node ≥ 22.
- **Root cause:** undici / Node-internal stream API drift; not in our code.
- **Next step:** bump `convex` SDK once upstream ships the fix, or pin Node
  to 20.x in `engines` and Railway/Vercel runtime config if the noise gets
  worse. Track upstream issue.
- **Risk if ignored:** log noise only — does not block requests. Becomes a
  real problem if real errors get hidden behind the spam.
- **Tags:** `#tech-debt` `#infra` `#noise`

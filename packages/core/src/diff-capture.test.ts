/**
 * Covers the ways the Codex path can arrive at a `before` side.
 *
 * Worth testing specifically because a wrong `before` picks a different branch
 * of `restoreFiles`, and one of them is destructive: a string is rewritten,
 * `isNew` is *deleted*, and `noBaseline` is refused. The dangerous confusion is
 * between the last two — a baseline that could not be read looks exactly like a
 * file that never existed, and undo then deletes a tracked file instead of
 * restoring it.
 *
 * This header used to claim `restoreFiles` "skips any diff whose `before` is
 * not a string", which was only ever true of the non-`isNew` branch.

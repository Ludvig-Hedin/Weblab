/**
 * The OpenCode backend.
 *
 * Architecturally unlike the other two. OpenCode is a client/server pair, not
 * an in-process iterator: the SDK shells out to `opencode serve` and speaks
 * HTTP + SSE, so a turn is a blocking `session.prompt` raced against a
 * server-wide event subscription carrying every session on it. The
 * choreography that follows exists for that reason, and `sessionIdOf`
 * filtering is a correctness requirement rather than tidiness.
 *
 * What it does better than Codex, and is used for here:
 * - Token-level streaming, so prose and reasoning render as they arrive.
 * - A real `system` field, so the preamble need not ride on the turn's text.
 * - Native `session.fork`: "try a different approach" keeps the history.
 * - Native `session.revert`, so `rewind()` is real rather than absent.
 * - Real cost on the assistant message, not just token counts.
 *
 * What it cannot do, handled explicitly rather than faked:
 * - No reasoning-effort control anywhere in the session or prompt API, so
 *   `--effort` is ignored; provider-specific equivalents are reachable only
 *   through `--opencode-config`.
 * - No `maxTurns` and no budget cap, as on Codex.
 * - No OS sandbox. `--safe` is approximated by asking for permission on every
 *   edit and command and answering from airship's own guards — a faithful port
 *   of the Claude posture, but raw network access is not cut — only the
 *   network tools are. Stated at launch and in the README.
 * - No in-process MCP: opencode's MCP servers are config-declared subprocesses,
 *   so `get_element_context` is not offered and the prompt inlines the
 *   selection instead.
 * - No bundled binary. The `opencode` CLI is a separate install; `checkAuth`
 *   looks for it on PATH and says so when it is missing.
 *
 * One further quirk shapes the code below: `format: { type: "json_schema" }`
 * is two things at once, and both matter. On the wire it is a *forced tool
 * call* — opencode registers an internal StructuredOutput tool and sets
 * `toolChoice: "required"` — which providers reject outright on thinking
 * models (opencode#15226, closed upstream); the adapter classifies that
 * rejection, retries the turn without `format`, and remembers the model. In
 * the text it is a tag convention: the model emits the JSON inside
 * `<structuredoutput>` tags within ordinary prose, and opencode's own
 * extractor frequently fails to lift it back out, so the payload is recovered
 * here, from the text, and kept out of the transcript on the way past. The
 * system prompt carries the same tag instruction now, which is what keeps the
 * recovery path alive when `format` was never sent.

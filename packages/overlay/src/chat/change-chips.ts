 *
 * The chips are deliberately quiet: a hover surface, a hairline border and
 * secondary text. They sit inches from the accent-filled Send button, and two
 * blue things side by side both claiming to be the important one is worse than
 * either. The selection chip keeps the accent, which makes it the one coloured

 * Make a horizontal chip rail reachable with a mouse, and say when it has more.
 *
 * The rail has always scrolled. What it had no way of telling you is that it
 * scrolls: the scrollbar was hidden outright, there was no wheel handler, and
 * nothing marked the edges. A trackpad papers over all three — a two-finger
 * swipe produces `deltaX` and scrolls the rail natively — so on a trackpad the
 * strip is fine and on a mouse the twelfth chip does not exist. Every wheel a
 * mouse sends is `deltaY`, and a box that only overflows on X ignores it.
 *
 * So: translate a vertical wheel into horizontal scroll, and publish how much
 * is off each end as `data-overflow` for the mask in `base.css`.
 *
 * `pixelDelta` rather than raw `deltaY`, for the reason written where it lives:
 * most mouse wheels report *lines* (a notch is `deltaY: 3`, not `120`), so the
 * unconverted value scrolls a rail by three pixels per notch and reads as
 * broken rather than as slow. That normalisation is the whole difference
 * between this working on a mouse and only appearing to.
 *
 * The gesture is declined at either end rather than clamped silently: an
 * uncancelled wheel there chains to the transcript above, which is what a
 * vertical wheel over a full rail should do.
 *
 * Self-syncing, because the caller cannot be trusted to remember both triggers:
 * chips arrive and leave without the rail's own box changing (MutationObserver),
 * and the dock resizes without the chips changing (ResizeObserver).
 *
 * A rail already scrolled to its end stays there when a chip is appended — the
 * same pin the transcript keeps (`AirshipApp.scrollTranscript`), and for the
 * same reason: the newest thing is what you just did and what you want to see
 * confirmed. A rail scrolled back is left alone, so reading chip three is not
 * interrupted by chip twelve arriving.
 *
 * It starts *un*pinned, which is the opposite of the transcript and is the
 * whole difference between the two: the transcript's newest entry is at the
 * bottom and nothing above it needs to stay in view, while this rail's leftmost
 * item is the *selection* chip — the one accent-coloured thing in the composer,
 * and the only thing saying what these edits are about. Pinning from the start
 * scrolled it off the moment the first change landed.

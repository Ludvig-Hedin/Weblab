/**
 * The frame list — what the left dock shows in view mode.
 *
 * Until now the only handle on a frame was the frame: its title on the canvas
 * was the sole entry point to selecting one, so a frame parked off-screen was
 * effectively lost, and there was nowhere at all that answered "what have I
 * got?". Eight is a small number, but it is more than enough to lose one in.
 *
 * It sits opposite the agent panel deliberately, in the mode where a frame is
 * the thing you are working on. Edit mode is about an element inside a frame,
 * and it already has two panels scoped to that; view mode is about the frames
 * themselves — `frame-chrome.ts` has restricted frame selection to view mode
 * since before this existed — so the list and the minimap take that slot rather
 * than leaving two element-scoped panels open over a mode with no element
 * selection.
 *
 * The verbs are not implemented here. They live in `frame-verbs.ts`, shared
 * with the canvas furniture and the bar, so a frame deleted from this list is
 * the same act with the same receipt and the same undo as one deleted with ⌫.
 * That file's header has the argument.

 * while `FrameManager` runs back-to-front. See `FramesPanel.stackOrder`.

 * Dimensions, Rotate, Reload, Duplicate and Delete — all five of which are now
 * buttons in the bottom bar's frame group, acting on the selected frame. Two
 * routes to one set of verbs is one more than this canvas needs, and the route
 * hanging off the frame was the one you had to already know was there.
 *
 * All of it is drawn in screen space at 1×, like the selection chrome — a title
 * that shrank to nothing at 20% zoom would defeat the purpose of zooming out to
 * see the whole canvas, which is precisely when you most need to tell frames
 * apart. Only the *positions* come from the world transform.
 *
 * Two resize gestures exist on this canvas and they are deliberately distinct:
 * the grips here change a **frame's viewport** (making the app inside reflow, as
 * a real browser resize would), while the grips in `picker.ts` change a selected
 * **element's CSS**. Frame grips sit on the frame's outer border, element grips
 * on the selection, and only one is ever armed for a given press.

   * was wrong and was reverted: identifying a frame, selecting it, moving it and
   * resizing it are canvas operations, and hiding them made view mode strictly

   * it hides with the group instead of leaving a hairline hanging off the Hand.

   * these are chosen rather than found:
   *
   * - `rotate-ccw` for Reload, because a circular arrow *is* the reload mark. It
   *   is also the Undo glyph — deliberately, and it is not a collision: Undo
   *   lives in `editOnlyBar` and this lives in `viewOnlyBar`, and `syncBar`
   *   guarantees the two are never on screen together.
   * - `doc-plus` for Duplicate: a frame is a document, and this makes one more.
   *
   * Delete was a third. It drew `minus`, on the argument that `−` is the literal
   * counterpart of the `+` three controls along — which is a real grammar, but
   * the wrong one: `+`/`−` over a *list* adds and removes a row, and this
   * destroys a frame. The same verb in the frame list drew `✕`, so one action
   * had two glyphs and neither said "destroy". The set now carries a `trash` of

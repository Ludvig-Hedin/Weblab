   \`Tooltips\` mounts it into the host above and its neighbours are the shells
   below it.

   \`z-index: 1\`, and not the global \`Z\`: the host is a stacking context of its
   own, so the global scale means nothing inside it. What this orders is the tip
   against its *siblings* — the \`.pop\` shells, which carry no z-index and are all
   appended after the tip, which is created once when the overlay mounts. Drop
   the number and DOM order takes over: the tip paints under every popover ever
   opened, which is how it reads on a control inside the colour picker.

   It wraps, and that is the shape of the whole rule. Most tips are one short
   line, but a handful carry values the editor did not author — a font stack, a
   stylesheet URL, a review comment body — and for those the tip *is* the
   untruncated view of a field that already truncated. Ellipsing them throws
   away the only thing they were opened for.

   This used to say \`white-space: nowrap\` alongside the same width cap and no
   overflow rule at all. Those cannot both hold: the text laid out at its full
   intrinsic width while the border, background and shadow painted at the cap, so
   from about 45 characters up the label sat outside its own box. It also made

   was as wide as the four visible verbs — about 158 — and snapped to ~250 the
   moment you opened a device group, which \`placePopover\` then read back as a
   different \`offsetWidth\` and turned into a horizontal jump on the next scroll.
   \`canvas.css.ts\` used to answer that with a hand-measured floor and a paragraph
   accepting an over-wide root pane as the price; \`.pop-group-body[inert]\` below
   answers it by not breaking the measurement in the first place, so there is no
   price and no number to keep in step with the device list.

   \`MENU_MAX_W\` is the remaining bound and it points the other way — see its

   The two halves of that sentence are the whole fix. \`.hidden\` is
   \`display: none !important\`, and a box that is not laid out contributes nothing
   to the shrink-to-fit width of the flex column above it — so this menu was one
   width with its groups shut and another with one open, and since
   \`placePopover\` derives \`left\` from \`offsetWidth\`, the width change was a
   sideways jump on the next scroll or resize as well. A shut group that is still
   laid out contributes its widest row's width, so the menu is as wide as its
   widest row *in any group* in every state, and there is no floor to maintain
   and no number to get wrong.

   \`block-size: 0\` collapses it on the axis it is being collapsed on — as a flex
   item its \`flex-basis: auto\` resolves to this, so the height really is zero and
   \`placePopover\`'s \`scrollHeight\` reads exactly what it read before.
   \`overflow: hidden\` clips what no longer fits, and is scoped to the shut state
   so an open group cannot clip a row's focus ring. \`visibility: hidden\` is the
   paint half; \`inert\` — the attribute this selects on — is the interaction half,
   and is what keeps a measured row out of the tab order, out of hit-testing and
   out of the accessibility tree. \`items()\` filters on that same attribute rather
   than trusting either, so the keyboard cursor is right even under happy-dom,

   the painted strip, which is exactly what it looked like. The reposition after
   each render fixes the height, and this makes the failure impossible rather
   than merely fixed.

   \`.pop\` is a scroller in its own right now, and this opts *out* of it: the

   Its own classes rather than the canvas's \`.fc-menu-custom\` trio, which is
   the same idea one shape away — that row holds two 62px number fields for a
   width and a height, and an identifier wants the whole width. Sharing them
   would mean one of the two callers overriding most of what it inherited. */

/* The knob travels inside the track, not across it.
   \`left\` used to be the raw percentage against a \`-7px\` margin, which put the
   knob's centre on the track's end at both extremes — so half of a 14px dial
   hung outside a 12px track, into the 8px of \`.pop-color-body\` padding, and
   came to rest one pixel from the shell's border. At 0% and 100%, which is
   where an alpha slider spends most of its life, it read as falling off.

   Travelling the *box* from 0 to \`100% - 14px\` keeps both ends flush with the
   track instead: the knob still marks the value it always did, because the
   track's own ends are what moved under it. The 14px is stated twice here and
   has to stay in step with \`width\`; there is no third place it appears.
   \`--knob\` is a 0-1 number written by \`color-picker.ts\`. */

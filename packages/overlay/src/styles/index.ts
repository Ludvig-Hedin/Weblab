// One stylesheet, assembled from co-equal modules. The order is the cascade:
// base establishes the reset and the icon colour roles, canvas is the substrate
// beneath the chrome, and chrome sits near the end so its z-indexed layers win
// ties. `pop` sits after `controls` because a popover's shell overrides control
// styling its content inherits, not the other way round. `toast` is the last of
// the *layers* because it is the topmost of them — see `Z_TOAST`; `motion` comes
// after it, but it is policy rather than a layer and overrides all of them.
//
// Two placements are load-bearing rather than aesthetic. `portable` goes
// directly after `base` because its text-edit rules and `base`'s edit-mode
// block both target the same node and can tie on specificity — and `portable`
// is the one that must win. It is also the only module here that is *not*
// exclusive to this document: `frame-agent.ts` serves the same string inside
// every frame, because the node it styles is a page node in both stages.

/**
 * The two discovery surfaces: the ⌘K palette and the `?` shortcuts sheet.
 *
 * Both are `.pop-modal` shells (see `pop.css.ts`), so the card, the centring
 * and the scrim come from there and this file is only what is inside them.
 *
 * They deliberately do not look the same. The palette is a *control* — one
 * column, one active row, sized like the rest of the editor's chrome — and the
 * sheet is a *document*, so it reads in two columns at a comfortable measure
 * and nothing in it is selectable. Making them share a skin would have made the
 * sheet look operable, which is the one thing it is not.

/* The results, and the grid every row's columns come from.

   A row carries two lines' worth of information — what it is, and what it does,
   the second being what makes a palette teachable rather than a list of names
   you already know — and it used to be *laid out* as two lines. It reads better
   as one: forty rows of two lines is a scroll rather than a list, and the second
   line was being blockified into a flex row and printed beside the title anyway.

   The tracks live on the *list*, not on the row, and that is the whole trick.
   Each \`.palette-row\` is a formatting context of its own, so a per-row grid
   sizes its title column from that row alone and forty rows land their sentences
   on forty different edges — the same argument \`.filter-row\` makes in
   \`controls.css.ts\` for its fixed value track, one level up. \`subgrid\` is what
   lets a row keep its own box, which it has to: \`.palette-row-on\` paints it and
   \`setActive\` calls \`scrollIntoView\` on it, and neither survives
   \`display: contents\`.

   \`fit-content()\` rather than a number, so the title column is as wide as the
   longest title *currently listed* — a query filtered down to "Undo" does not
   reserve room for "Drop the change you are on" — and \`PALETTE_TITLE_MAX\` only
   stops one long title from eating the sentence beside it. */

/* The fallback, and deliberately the base rule rather than the override.

   \`grid-template-columns: subgrid\` is an *invalid value* where it is not
   supported, so the declaration is dropped whole and the row would fall back to
   a one-column grid stacking its three cells vertically — worse than the flex
   row this replaces. So the literal column is declared first and the measured
   one overrides it inside \`@supports\`, rather than the other way round.

   The row keeps its own inline padding and the list has none, so the highlight
   below is full-bleed. Padding on a subgrid item does inset its tracks from the
   parent's grid lines — but every row here carries the *same* padding, so they
   are inset identically and go on agreeing with each other, which is the only
   thing the subgrid is here to do. Only the list's other children have to be
   padded to match, and \`.pop-head\` is. Inset instead, the active row was a
   1318px stripe with a 4px radius floating in a 16px margin: too wide for the

/* A grid, not \`justify-content: space-between\`.

   The chip track is a fixed width, and that is the point: every \`.sc-row\` is a
   formatting context of its own, so an \`auto\` track is sized by *that row's*
   chips alone and sixty rows each land their chip block on a different left
   edge. \`.filter-row\` in \`controls.css.ts\` makes the identical argument — "the
   value track is fixed rather than a minmax range so every row in a stack lines
   its numbers up on the same edge".

   A variable rather than a literal, because the sheet renders two different
   things into that column. A chord tops out at "Ctrl+Shift+Z": twelve characters
   of JetBrains Mono at \`--ap-font-size-caption\` (10px, so about 6px a
   character) plus a \`.sc-key\`'s 12px of padding and border, or 84. A *gesture's*
   input is a phrase — "Wheel over the selected frame" is 29 characters, about
   186px, and \`.sc-key\` declares \`white-space: nowrap\` so it cannot give any of
   it back. One track sized for the phrase would spend 186px of a 408px column on
   a gutter in every command section; one sized for the chord would push the
   phrase out over its own name. So the gesture section declares its own.

   112 rather than 84 because a handful of commands answer to two chords. Redo is
   the worst pair — "Ctrl+Shift+Z" and "Ctrl+Y", 136 together — and it wraps onto
   a second line *inside its own track* rather than overhanging into the name,

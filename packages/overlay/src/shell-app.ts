   * all while focus is inside the frame.
   *
   * That second one had no caller for the life of the module, and the bug it
   * fixes is written in its own docstring: a keydown inside a same-origin
   * iframe never reaches the shell's `document`, so in view mode — the only
   * mode where a frame takes focus, since edit mode makes them
   * `pointer-events: none` — Escape, the zoom keys and everything else were
   * simply dead the moment you clicked into your own app. Which commands are
   * allowed through from there is the catalog's `inFrame` flag, not this
   * line's business: routing all of them would let `f` add a frame while
   * somebody filled in a form.
   *
   * Disposal-first, because this fires again on every reload with a brand-new
   * document, and `pruneFrameUnsubs` takes the rest when a frame goes away.

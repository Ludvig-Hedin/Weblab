/**
 * Sort strongest-first and strike every declaration a stronger one repeats.
 *
 * Modelled on the cascade rather than on the computed value. Comparing a
 * declaration's text to `getComputedStyle` looks equivalent and is not:
 * shorthands expand, `em` resolves to `px`, and colours normalise to `rgb()`,
 * so a rule that genuinely won would be struck through for "disagreeing" with
 * the value it produced.
 *
 * Overriding is decided **per declaration**, and display order **per rule**. Those
 * are two different questions and conflating them was a real bug: the old
 * `byCascade` promoted a whole rule above every non-important one if *any* of its
 * declarations carried `!important`, so given
 *
 *     #hero  { color: red;              font-size: 32px }
 *     .title { color: blue !important;  font-size: 12px }
 *
 * `.title` sorted first wholesale and `#hero`'s `font-size: 32px` — which actually
 * wins — was struck through. Worse than cosmetic: `winningDeclaration` in
 * `tokens/match.ts` reads "the first non-overridden declaration", so the token badge
 * named a token from the *losing* rule and shipped it to the agent as evidence.

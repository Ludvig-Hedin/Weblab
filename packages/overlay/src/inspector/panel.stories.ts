/*
 * The whole Design panel, as the right dock, beside the page it is inspecting.
 *
 * No shadowing here and nothing partial: this is `DesignPanel` doing exactly
 * what it does in the product, with `harness()` supplying the collaborators that
 * would otherwise need a socket, a stage and a live selection controller.
 *
 * These are the stories to reach for when the question is about the panel as a
 * whole rather than about one control — the order of the sections, how much
 * vertical space a typical element consumes, whether the Scope row earns its
 * place at the top. `renderSections`'s own comment states the invariant that
 * makes the set vary: anything gating a section there must also appear in
 * `shapeKey`, or the section fails to appear or disappear when the element
 * changes under a refresh rather than a reselect. Each subject below lands on a
 * different branch of that gate, so between them they are the visual statement
 * of what `shapeKey` is for.
 *
 * Which makes the accuracy of the subjects the whole point, and until recently
 * two of these were wrong. `Vector` asked for `icon`, which resolved the `<svg>`
 * root — where `isSvgChild` is false *by definition* — so the story documenting
 * the most aggressively gated path in the panel was showing the ungated one, and
 * that path had no coverage anywhere in the catalogue. It now asks for `path`
 * and `SvgRoot` covers what it used to show, which are genuinely two different
 * pictures.

 * plausible, and wrong.
 *
 * Putting the subject in its own document fixes it by being *more* faithful:
 * this is the production topology, which is why `realm.ts` exists.
 *
 * It is also the only place the CSS pane can be seen at all. `style-model.ts`
 * notes that happy-dom implements no `CSSStyleDeclaration` iterator, "which is

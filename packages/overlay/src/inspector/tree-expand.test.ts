/**
 * Who owns a tree row's disclosure.
 *
 * There was no test covering tree expansion at all, and the bug it would have
 * caught shipped: the auto-expand path was seeded at the selection itself and
 * OR-ed over the user's `expanded` set, so the selected row was force-open —
 * `toggleExpand` on it was a no-op forever. The contract now: the selection
 * opens once, on first sight, and from then on its chevron belongs to the
 * user; strict ancestors stay pinned because collapsing one would hide the
 * selected row, and the tree *is* the selection UI here.

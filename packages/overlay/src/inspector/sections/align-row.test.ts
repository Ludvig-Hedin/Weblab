/**
 * One align click is one undo step.
 *
 * `applyAlign` fans a plan's declarations with a bare `ctx.recordOn` per
 * declaration and no bracket around them. `recordOn` ends at `journalDecl`,
 * which calls `history.push`, and an unbatched `push` goes straight to
 * `commit([op])` — its own entry on the undo stack. So the buttons whose plans
 * carry more than one declaration cost one ⌘Z *per declaration* to take back:
 * Tidy up on a flex parent writes `display`, `flex-direction`, `gap` and
 * `align-items`, and needed four.
 *
 * The section already had no tests. This is the outcome-level one — it counts
 * real steps on a real `History` rather than asserting that a batch was opened,
 * because the batch is the fix and the step count is the bug.

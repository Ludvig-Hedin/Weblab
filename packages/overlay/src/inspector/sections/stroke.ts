/**
 * The Stroke section: a stroke row, a weight field, and everything else
 * behind an advanced-settings popover.
 *
 * It used to be four flat things stacked — colour, widths, a full-width Style
 * segmented group, a full-width Position segmented group — so a section whose
 * everyday use is "make this border 1px grey" was four rows tall and the two
 * rows you set once and forget occupied half of it.
 *
 * The row deliberately reuses Fill's `.rows` chrome without `createRowList`:
 * that primitive's value model is "an array serialised into one CSS property"
 * and a border is four longhands, so routing it through would need a fake
 * `cssProperty`. Sharing the classes is the honest half of the reuse.
 */
/**
 * The four longhands for one border property, so this section never writes a shorthand.
 *
 * Everything else here writes `border-<side>-<prop>` — deliberately, because
 * "the shorthand was the one declaration in this section that could not describe what
 * the section was showing". Add and Remove did not, and the change set is keyed per
 * property, so *both* survived: set `border-top-width: 8px`, click Remove stroke, and
 * the payload carried `border-top-width: 8px` **and** `border-width: 0px`. Which one
 * landed in the source depended on emission order.
 *
 * A shorthand also cannot be taken back cleanly — `border-width: 0px` leaves the four
 * longhands in place and merely loses to them — which is why Remove looked like it had
 * worked while the quad field still read `8`.
 *
 * The first line was aspirational for a long time. Three writes still used the
 * shorthand — the eye, the width field's implied `solid`, and the Style select —
 * and the eye's was a live bug: `hasStroke` reads the longhands through
 * `ctx.gate`, which does no shorthand expansion, so once *Add stroke* had
 * written a pending `solid` on them the shorthand `none` could never win, and
 * the eye did nothing. All three go through `writeAllEdges` now.
 *
 * The reads had the mirror-image problem and are fixed the same way: every one
 * of them asked `border-top-*` and answered for the box. See `edgeValue`.

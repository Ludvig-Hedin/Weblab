/**
 * Scroll a node into view (centered) only when it isn't already fully visible,

 * the DOM tab (row click + drop) — not the pick path, where the user just
 * clicked a visible element.
 *
 * "Visible" is measured against the node's *own* window. In a frame that is the
 * frame's viewport, which is the whole point: a node can be off-screen inside a
 * 375px frame while the frame itself is fully on the canvas.

/*
 * Undo and redo for direct manipulation.
 *
 * Easier here than it looks, because the edit sets are already `(from, to)` diff
 * buffers — so undo is a journal of *operations*, not a stack of snapshots.
 *
 * **The invariant, and the only rule this file has:** an op may be journalled
 * if and only if enacting it puts the DOM *and* the set that owns it back
 * together. Airship previews an edit by mutating the live page and tells the
 * agent about it separately, so a DOM-only undo does not undo anything — it
 * makes the page disagree with the payload, silently, until the agent runs and
 * re-applies the change the user just took back. `style` got this right from the
 * start by replaying through `ChangeSet`; `insert`, `remove` and `text` did not,
 * and moves and attribute edits were never journalled at all.
 *
 * That is why this file no longer knows what an op *means*. It owns the stacks,
 * the batching and the direction; `history-ops.ts` owns enactment and is the one
 * place with every set in scope. A new op kind cannot be added here without
 * giving it an arm there, which is exactly the coupling that was missing.
 *
 * The one genuinely fiddly part is coalescing: a number scrub emits a change per
 * pointermove, so without `batch()` a single drag would leave 200 undo steps.

       * - **`from` cannot be recomputed.** Rebuilding a declaration through the
       *   ordinary write path reads the current DOM, which the undo has already
       *   stripped the preview from, turning `16px → 24px` into `24px → 24px`.
       * - **Intent is part of the state.** A token binding and a detach live on
       *   the `Change`; replaying only a value silently dropped them.
       *
       * `null` on either side means "no declaration", which is where a first
       * edit comes from and where a delete goes.

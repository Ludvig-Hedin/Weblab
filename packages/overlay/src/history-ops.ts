/*
 * Enacting one journalled operation, in either direction.
 *
 * This is the other half of `history.ts`, and it exists because of the rule
 * stated there: undoing an Airship edit means putting the DOM *and* the set that
 * owns it back together. Airship previews by mutating the live page and tells
 * the agent about it separately, so a DOM-only undo is not an undo — it is a
 * silent disagreement between what the user sees and what the agent will be
 * asked to write.
 *
 * `History` used to enact ops itself, and could only reach the DOM. `style` was
 * the exception, wired to `ChangeSet.replay` through a callback, and it was the
 * only kind that worked: undoing a delete put the element back on screen and
 * left the delete queued, undoing a text edit restored the old string and
 * shipped the new one, and a drag was never journalled at all — so ⌘Z after one
 * either reported "Nothing to undo" or reached past it and took back an earlier
 * style tweak instead.
 *
 * Every arm below therefore ends in a set method. Where a set already had the
 * right one it is used as-is (`MoveSet.remove` is exactly "undo a move"); where
 * it did not, the method was added there rather than open-coded here, so the
 * knowledge of what an edit means stays with the edit.

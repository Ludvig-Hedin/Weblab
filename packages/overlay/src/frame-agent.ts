 * `iframe.contentDocument` is just there — and for most work it does exactly
 * that. This agent exists for the operations that are not realm-portable:
 *
 * - `extractElementInfo` walks React's fiber tree and does its own `instanceof`
 *   checks against the realm it was loaded in. Called from the shell on a frame
 *   node it would resolve nothing, and would do it quietly. Here it runs in the
 *   same realm as the React that produced the node, next to the bippy hook the
 *   proxy injected into this document's `<head>`.
 * - Layout notifications need listeners bound to *this* window, since the shell
 *   cannot observe a scroll or a mutation it is not in the document for.
 *
 * Style reads and writes are deliberately *not* here. `inspector/style-model.ts`
 * resolves `getComputedStyle` against the node's own window (see `../realm.ts`),
 * so the shell can drive them directly on a frame node; routing them through
 * here as well would be a second way to do the same thing.
 *
 * The agent mounts no UI, injects no overlay chrome, and opens no control
 * socket. There is one WebSocket per session and the shell owns it.

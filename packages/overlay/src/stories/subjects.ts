/*
 * The elements the inspector inspects.
 *
 * These are the actual subject of every section and panel story. The inspector
 * is a *view of a node* — it reads computed style, walks the stylesheets that
 * matched, measures the box — so a story that shows the panel without saying
 * what it is pointed at is showing an opinion with no premise.
 *
 * They are *real DOM in a real browser*, which is the whole reason this exists
 * alongside the happy-dom suite. `getBoundingClientRect` returns a measured box
 * with no `sizeOf()` patch; `getComputedStyle` resolves shorthands, percentages
 * and inherited values properly; and the stylesheet below is parsed by a real
 * CSS parser, so the nesting, `@layer` and `@supports` that happy-dom drops
 * entirely are genuinely there for `matchedRules` to walk.
 *
 * ## One specimen per story, not one page for all of them
 *
 * This module used to build a single two-card demo page and hand out nodes from
 * it by selector. Every panel and section story rendered that whole page beside
 * the dock, so forty-one stories were the same picture with a few rows different
 * several hundred pixels to the right — and since nothing marked which node the
 * panel was pointed at, telling them apart meant reading the values and working
 * backwards.
 *
 * It also went quietly wrong three times, which is the more serious charge. The
 * `SELECTOR` map was a second place to state which element a story was about,
 * and it drifted from the prose: `grid` resolved `.tiles`, the *container*, so
 * the story captioned "a tile painted with a gradient" pointed at an element
 * with no background at all and rendered an empty Fill section, and the one
 * captioned "a tile with a translucent border" was byte-identical to the story
 * named `None` three lines above it. `icon` resolved the `<svg>` root, so the
 * two stories claiming to demonstrate `isSvgChild` — the most aggressively gated
 * path in `renderSections` — demonstrated the opposite branch, and that path had
 * no coverage anywhere.
 *
 * Both classes of bug are gone by construction now: a specimen carries its own
 * subject as a `[data-subject]` marker in the markup, so the element a story
 * points at is stated once, in the same string as the element itself.
 *
 * ## The constraint that shapes the stylesheet
 *
 * **The rules must stay bare class selectors.** `scopeLevels` only offers a
 * class scope when the matched selector is a single bare class (`SIMPLE_CLASS`
 * in `inspector/cascade.ts`) *and* more than one element in the document carries
 * it. Scoping this sheet under `.specimen` — the obvious way to keep specimens
 * from bleeding into each other — would turn every rule into a descendant
 * selector, `SIMPLE_CLASS` would reject all of them, and the Scope row would
 * silently collapse to "This element" on every story in the catalogue. There is
 * nothing to bleed into anyway: one specimen renders at a time.
 *
 * The second half of that rule is why `SpecimenSpec.siblings` exists. A scope is
 * only meaningful when the class is shared, so a specimen that wants the Scope
 * row to mean something *declares* the element it shares with, rather than
 * happening to have one because it was cropped out of a bigger page.
 */

/**
 * The specimen stylesheet.
 *
 * Deliberately written the way a real app's is, not the way a fixture usually
 * is: cascade layers, native nesting, a `:hover` rule, a media query, an
 * `@supports` block and shared classes that several elements match. Every one of
 * those is a branch in `inspector/css-rules.ts`'s walker, and `test-support.ts`
 * has to fake all of them with a synthetic CSSOM because happy-dom parses none.
 *
 * One sheet for all thirteen specimens rather than one each. The at-rules are
 * properties of the *sheet*, so sharing it keeps every specimen exercising all
 * of them; splitting it would make `@layer` ordering and the `scopeLevels`
 * element counts depend on which sheet happened to be injected. A specimen
 * carrying rules for classes it does not use is what a real app's stylesheet
 * does anyway, and it exercises the walker's non-match filtering, which is work
 * it genuinely has to do.

/**
 * The same specimens, in their own document, with a `Surface` pointed at them.
 *
 * This exists for one specific and non-obvious reason. `stubSurface()` in
 * `test-support.ts` returns `doc: document` — which under happy-dom is a clean
 * empty document, and in Storybook is the *preview iframe*, carrying Storybook's
 * own stylesheets. `matchedRules` walks `doc.styleSheets`, and `isOwnSheet` skips
 * the overlay's sheet but knows nothing about Storybook's. So a CSS-pane story on
 * a same-document subject would list Storybook's reset as the element's
 * provenance, which is worse than useless: it is a plausible wrong answer.
 *
 * Putting the subject in its own document fixes it exactly, and does so by being
 * more faithful rather than less — this is the production topology. In canvas
 * mode the app runs in frame iframes while the overlay runs in the shell, which
 * is why `realm.ts` exists at all. The panel resolves `getComputedStyle` against
 * the node's own window and duck-types its `instanceof` checks, so it handles
 * this natively.

/*
 * Standing a `DesignPanel` up for a story, and rendering one section of it.
 *
 * This is the only file in the catalogue that reaches into `DesignPanel`'s
 * private members, and it is deliberately the only one. The idiom is the one
 * `panel-refresh.test.ts` already uses — `panel as unknown as Internals` — and
 * the guard below is what keeps it from being a landmine.
 *
 * ## Why a section story drives the real panel
 *
 * Every section is `render<Name>(ctx: SectionContext, node: Element)`, and
 * `SectionContext` has 23 members. The obvious two ways to supply one are both
 * worse than this:
 *
 * **A hand-written fake context** would be about 150 lines and would silently
 * diverge. `seed()` is `Mixed`-aware across a multi-selection; `gate()` reads the
 * pending edit *before* computed style, so a gate does not delete the row whose
 * own edit just failed to paint; `repaintScope()` has disposal semantics that
 * exist because sections were leaking controls on every repaint. A fake
 * reproduces the shapes and not the behaviour, and nothing tells you when it
 * stops matching.
 *
 * **Borrowing the real `ctx` and rendering the section into a bare div** looks
 * cheaper and misbehaves in six ways, all of them quiet. `ctx.rerender` is
 * `() => this.renderBody()`, which destroys every registered control and clears
 * the panel's own body — so the story's DOM survives with dead controls inside
 * it. Overriding `ctx.rerender` does not help, because `applyToken`, `setScope`,
 * `setState` and `reshapeIfNeeded` all call `renderBody()` directly. There would
 * be no `beginScanPass()` bracket, so `matchedRules` runs uncached and its 24ms
 * budget truncates at a different rule on each of the up-to-four calls one
 * section makes — leaving two consumers disagreeing about which rules matched.
 * `ctx.register` pushes into `panel.controls` with nothing ever clearing it, so
 * `reseed()` writes into detached DOM. `section()` keys collapse state on an id
 * that the panel's own body has already claimed. And `tokenCache` is only reset
 * inside `renderBodyInner`, so badges go stale across repaints.
 *
 * ## What this does instead
 *
 * `renderSections` is a TypeScript `private` — a plain prototype method, not a
 * `#private` field — and its entire body is sixteen
 * `this.bodyEl.append(render*(this.ctx, node))` calls. An instance property
 * shadows it. The section is then rendered by the *real* `renderBodyInner`, so
 * every hazard above is handled by the code that already handles it: the real
 * teardown runs, the real `beginScanPass()` try/finally wraps the pass,
 * `controls` and `tokenCache` are reset, scroll and caret are restored, and the
 * open popover is closed against its vanishing anchor.
 *
 * The cost is one cast against three private names, guarded at runtime so a
 * rename fails loudly at story load rather than rendering an empty dock.

 *
 * The old order was: build the specimen, append it to `document.body` so it is
 * measurable, construct the panel — which seeds from the box it measures right
 * there — and only *then* hand the page to `stage()`, which re-parents it into
 * `.__airship-story-page`, a flex child several hundred pixels narrower with a
 * different font and its own padding. Everything geometric had already been
 * read: Position's X and Y, Size's Hug/Fill decision, the measured width in the
 * selection badge. The story then displayed those numbers beside a rendering of
 * the element at a different size, and `sections/layout.stories.ts` claimed in
 * its header to be "the only place the geometry sections are shown real
 * numbers".
 *
 * The frame path could never be synchronous, for a different reason with the
 * same shape: **moving an iframe in the DOM reloads it**, so writing the subject
 * before Storybook appends the story would leave a blank pane and a `Surface`
 * aimed at a document that no longer exists — silently, since the panel would go
 * on reading the now-empty page and reporting it correctly.
 *
 * So both wait one animation frame. Storybook's HTML renderer appends what
 * `render` returns synchronously, so by the first frame the story is in its
 * final place and the specimen is laid out where the reader can see it. The cost
 * is one frame of an empty `.insp` shell — a panel that is about to exist,
 * rather than a flash of the wrong thing.
